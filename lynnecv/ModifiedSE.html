            <h2>14.3 Space Acquisition Plan</h2>
            <p>To meet these additional requirements, we have developed the following space acquisition plan:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Lease additional space adjacent to our current premises to create a dedicated Electoral Commission project facility.</li>
                <li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Lease separate facilities in close proximity to our current premises.</li>
                <li><strong>Option 3:</strong> If required by the Electoral Commission, establish dedicated facilities at or near the NROC location.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are flexible and willing to adjust our space arrangements based on the specific requirements and preferences of the Electoral Commission.</p>

            <h2>14.4 Facility Security</h2>
            <p>All our facilities maintain appropriate security measures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>24/7 security monitoring and alarm systems</li>
                <li>Access control systems</li>
